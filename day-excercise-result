make sure you are not logged in with admin. login with your user like user1 user2 and so on.

Task1-
Create an image with dockerfile in which httpd must be installed and the index.html should contain "hey" string initially.
Create an deployment and use that image. replica must be 3 and in all 3 replicas in index.html, hey, hey1 and hey2 must be written. try to go to each pod and change it. vim and vi command wont work there. use echo to redirect.
label on the pod must be app: web
create a service with file. copy that from google by searching service kubernetes
create a route with file. copy that from google. by searching route openshift and go to route configuration.
in route hostname must be <yourname>.apps.testlab.mayankmodi.xyz
curl on it and raise your hands
